# Course_Management_System
This is a Course Management System that can add courses, students, and teachers to its platform.
It has 3 separate menus for Admin, Student, and Teacher. They can perform tasks on their own.
Admin Menu has the option to add a course, remove a course, edit a course, view the course list, view the student list, view the teacher list, etc.
Students can register themselves from the student menu and they can register for a course, withdraw from a course, view the course list. Courses have a particular amount of seats so to avoid interference of multiple students register method is synchronized.
Teachers can register themselves from the teacher menu and check if there is a vacancy in any course that they can teach. They will submit their skills to admin and then the admin will permit them to register if they are qualified enough to teach a particular course. They can also withdraw from the course.
